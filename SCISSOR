(Game: scissor, rock, paper) Write a program that plays the popular scissor-rockpaper
game. (A scissor can cut a paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and a paper can wrap a
rock.) The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing scissor, rock,
and paper. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or 2 and displays a
message indicating whether the user or the computer wins, loses, or draws.

CODE:
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Q5 {

public static void main(String[] args) {

final int scissor = 0;
final int rock = 1;
final int paper = 2;

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
Random random = new Random();

System.out.print(&quot;Scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): &quot;);

int user = sc.nextInt();

if (user == 0 || user == 1 || user == 2) {

int comp = random.nextInt(3);
switch (user) {
case 0:
if (comp == scissor) {

System.out.println(&quot;The computer is scissor and you are scissor, it&#39;s

a draw.&quot;);
} else if (comp == rock) {
System.out.println(&quot;The computer is rock and you are scissor, you lost.&quot;);
} else if (comp == paper) {
System.out.println(&quot;The computer is paper and you are scissor, you won.&quot;);

}
break;
case 1:
if (comp == scissor) {
System.out.println(&quot;The computer is scissor and you are rock, you won.&quot;);
} else if (comp == rock) {
System.out.println(&quot;The computer is rock and you are rock, its a draw.&quot;);
} else if (comp == paper) {
System.out.println(&quot;The computer is paper and you are rock, you lost.&quot;);
}
break;
case 2:
if (comp == scissor) {
System.out.println(&quot;The computer is scissor and you are paper, you lost.&quot;);
} else if (comp == rock) {
System.out.println(&quot;The computer is rock and you are paper, you won.&quot;);
} else if (comp == paper) {
System.out.println(&quot;The computer is paper and you are paper, it&#39;s a draw.&quot;);
}
break;

}

} else {
System.out.println(&quot;Computer wins,Since you input an invalid value!&quot;);
